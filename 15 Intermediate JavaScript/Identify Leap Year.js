/* 
Leap Year Challenge Exercise
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 

This is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;
except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;
unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.

e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?:
2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)
2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)
*/

function isLeap(year) {
    if (year % 4 === 0) {
        if (year % 100 === 0) {
            if (year % 400 === 0) {
                return "Leap year.";
            }
            else {
                return "Not leap year.";
            }
        }
        else
            return "Leap year.";
    }
    else {
        return "Not leap year";
    }
}

var year = prompt("Enter the year");
alert(isLeap(year));
