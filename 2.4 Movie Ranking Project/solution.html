<h1>The Best Movies According to Mrunmai</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
  The concept of revolting against the system is always challenging and also
  very intriguing. Fincher makes the film look effortless; shot like a fancy
  music video compilation and working like a magician's best trick. This will
  always be one of the most memorable, quotable and re-watchable movies of all
  time.

<h3>Once Upon a Time in the West</h3>
<p>
  It says a lot that this film is chosen instead of the other Leone masterpiece
  listed below; but for all of its lengthy shots, staring characters and blue
  eyed villains, there's a charm to this film which makes everybody who stayed
  for the whole ride leave the cinema with a smile on their face and a simple
  "That was awesome!" on their lips.

<h3>Pulp Fiction (1994)</h3>
<p>
  Not to be confused with unreliable narrator, this is THE film that basically
  started the fire of such movies. Every minute there's a shot or a dialog you
  will remember weeks after you first see the movie. Sam L. Jackson will never
  be the same in your eyes either.
